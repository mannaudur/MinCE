### This should be a rough outline, which I can base my SnakeMake pipeline on.

# Preparation: Place all fasta files you want for the set (here, assuming file extension .fna) into folder genome_fasta_files/

mkdir sketches/

find genome_fasta_files/ -name "*.fna" > database_of_genomes.txt

# Sketches fasta files of database:
## k can be increased if more accuracy is needed, s is size of sketch which can also be increased

./NewCode/local/bin/sketch -k 31 -s 5000 -c 1 -d sketches/ -f database_of_genomes.txt 

mkdir clusters/

# Performs rudementary clustering on dataset with union-find and writes results to .cluster files in clusters/. Also creates hash_locator file and indices file
## l is threshold for union, meaning number of shared hashes between sketch i and sketch j, needed to join sketch i into union-find cluster containing sketch j

./NewCode/local/bin/cluster -l 4997 all_sketches.txt

find clusters/ -name "*.cluster" > all_clusters.txt

mkdir cliques/

# Creates cliques within union-find clusters and writes results to .clique files in cliques/. 
# Also creates index file, an updated version of indices, which is probably redundant.
## t is threshold of size to break up, clusters of size less than or equal to t will be left alone
## i is threshold of distance to stop bottoms up process, cliques a distance more than or equal to i will be lumped into their nearest clique 

python3 bottomUpCliques.py -t 5 -i 4 all_clusters.txt

find cliques/ -name "*.clique" > all_cliques.txt

# Creates .tsv and .fasta out of clique files, chooses distinguishing k-mers using those files and logs them in .minced file

./NewCode/local/bin/sequences -k 31 -N 10 -f all_cliques.txt

# Chooses distinguishing k-mers for each clique
## k is length of sequences chosen, computed each time as min(k, len(fasta_sequence))
## n is number of sequences that appear in each member of clique, computed as min(n, len(all_possible_sequences_in_member))





#optional: rm -rf cliques/ clusters/ sketches/ genome_fasta_files/ database_of_genomes.txt all_sketches.txt all_clusters.txt all_cliques.txt indices

# End: That's it. You'd should be able to run ./mince now on your samples.
