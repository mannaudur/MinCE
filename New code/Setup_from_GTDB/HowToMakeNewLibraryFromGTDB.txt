1. From https://data.gtdb.ecogenomic.org/releases/, select the release you want to constitute the MinCE library.

    Example: Current library is built from https://data.gtdb.ecogenomic.org/releases/release207/207.0/

2. Download taxonomy files for both bacteria and archaea.
    
    Example: Download bac120_taxonomy_r207.tsv and ar53_taxonomy_r207.tsv

3. Run GTDB_to_ASAC.py on both .tsv files, extracting only the Assembly accession identifiers for each genome to a new file "_accession.txt"

    Example: python3 GTDB_to_ASAC.py ar53_taxonomy_r207.tsv -n ar53_accession.txt

4. Download Entrez Direct through the steps described on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/.

5. a) For archaea and bacteria, run the accession file against esummary, extracting Id, Assembly Accession and Assembly Name to a new ".index" file

    Example: esummary -db assembly -input ar53_accession.txt | xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Id, AssemblyAccession, FtpPath_GenBank, FtpPath_RefSeq > archaea207.index

    Comment: As a safety check, run missing_from_index.py on accession file and index file. Log results as missing if 'GCA'<->'GCF' conversion doesn't work.

5. b) Run Index_to_RSYNC.py on both .index files, creating one '_rsync.txt' file and one '_missing.txt' file.

    Example: python3 Index_to_RSYNC.py archaea207.index -f ar53_found_1_rsync.txt -m ar53_missing_1.txt

5. c) Repeat step 5 a) for all '*_missing.txt' files.

    Example: esummary -db assembly -input ar53_missing.txt | xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Id, AssemblyAccession, FtpPath_GenBank, FtpPath_RefSeq > update_archaea207.index

5. d) Repeat step 5 b) for each file resulting from step 5 c)

    Example: python3 Index_to_RSYNC.py update_archaea207.index -f ar53_found_2_rsync.txt -m ar53_missing_2.txt

6. Log genomes in files '*_missing_2.txt' as members missing from the MinCE library.

    Comment: Optionally, you can try to fetch the remaining members of '_missing_2.txt' by hand, as other versions may be available.

7. Run rsync to fetch all files in the results '*_found_*_rsync.txt' files and pipe them into your desired directory

    Example: rsync --copy-links -va --no-relative rsync://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/ --files-from=ar53_found_1_rsync.txt genomes/

    Comment: Depending on your system and internet connection, this might take some time.

8. If you have multiple .index files for bacteria or archaea, concatenate them to form one file for each kingdom.

9. When all genomes are downloaded, run clean_up_index.py on both archaea and bactera .index files, obtaining the final MinCE.index file.

10. That's it, now move onto 'Order_of_operations.txt' for next steps in setting up a new MinCE library.
